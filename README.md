# My solutions to FCC algorithm challanges

A lot of the code has notes.

Also includes the projects for the algorithm projects.

Not necessarily good solitions but they do work and I had fun doing them. I prefered to work on them in a text editor so I've kept the files. I may use them one day for other languages.
